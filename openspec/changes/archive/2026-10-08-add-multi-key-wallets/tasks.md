# Tasks: add-multi-key-wallets

Speckit builds these; OpenSpec ratified them. The realization feature is
`specs/015-multi-key-wallets/`.

## 1. The schema — ADDITIVE, one digested file

- [x] 1.1 `contracts/openxwallet/openxwallet-record.schema.yaml`: add OPTIONAL
      top-level `keys:` — an array of ADDITIONAL declared keys beside
      `key_reference` (design D1), `additionalProperties: false` on the array's
      item as everywhere else, `minItems: 1` so an empty list cannot stand in for
      an absent one.
- [x] 1.2 Each `keys[]` item: REQUIRED `did`, `key_id`, `key_fingerprint`,
      `custody`; OPTIONAL `public_key_multibase`, `signature_algorithm`,
      `state`, `display_label`. `custody` is the SAME shape as the wallet's
      top-level block (design D2). `key_fingerprint` pattern
      `^sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$` (design D5). `state` is the SAME closed set as the
      wallet's own — `active | suspended | revoked` — and defaults to `active`
      when absent (design D9). `did` is REQUIRED, matching `key_reference`.
- [x] 1.3 Admit OPTIONAL `key_fingerprint` on the existing `key_reference`, same
      pattern. State the asymmetry with `keys[]` and its reason IN the schema
      description (alignment defect 1, concern 2).
- [x] 1.4 Describe IN THE SCHEMA: the declared key SET is `key_reference` plus
      `keys`; a record omitting `keys` declares one key; no key-material property
      exists at the new depth either; a declaration is APPEND-ONLY and retirement
      is a state change (D9); and the wallet's top-level `custody` block is BOTH
      the wallet's issuance ceiling AND the primary key's per-key custody (D10) —
      the one field doing two jobs, said out loud where a reader meets it.
- [x] 1.5 Version fields, named exactly (design D8, alignment concern 10): the
      file's `contract_schema_version: 1 → 2`; the file's own top-level
      `schema_version: 1` does NOT move. Confirm no other digested contract byte
      moves. There is no `docs/contract-versioning-policy.md` in this
      repository, so the applied rule is AGENTS.md rule 6 plus D8's reading,
      recorded in the CHANGELOG.

## 2. The validator — `scripts/validate-openxwallet.py`

- [x] 2.1 ONE function computes the declared key set —
      `declared_keys(doc) -> [(key_id, custody, declaration_site)]`, primary
      first — and every rule that needs the set calls it (design D1). Duplicates
      are not collapsed there; 2.3 needs to see them.
- [x] 2.2 `Context.index`: index EVERY declared key into `wallets_by_key`, so
      rule (r) resolves against the declared SET (design D4). Type-guarded like
      the existing index, which runs BEFORE schema validation.
- [x] 2.3 `check_wallet_record`: run the closed-set check per declared key under
      the EXISTING `custody-model-unknown` code, with the failing key and its
      declaration site named (design D2). The WALLET-LEVEL check keeps its exact
      current form and runs independently of whether `key_reference.key_id`
      parses — a malformed primary reference must not leave the wallet's own
      custody declaration unadjudicated.
- [x] 2.4 `check_wallet_record`: NEW `declared-key-duplicate` — a wallet
      declaring one `key_id` more than once, including a `keys[]` entry repeating
      `key_reference.key_id` (design D1/D4).
- [x] 2.5 `check_wallet_record`: NEW `declared-key-raises-authority` — a declared
      key whose custody ceiling RANKS ABOVE the wallet's own (design D2). Keyed
      on rank, not tier name.
- [x] 2.6 `check_wallet_record`: NEW `declared-key-fingerprint-mismatch` — where
      a `keys[]` entry declares `public_key_multibase`, the `key_fingerprint`
      must RECOMPUTE from it: base58btc-decode, require the two-byte ed25519
      multicodec prefix and 32 raw bytes, and compare
      `"sha256:" + sha256(raw).hexdigest()` (design D5). Conditional on the
      optional field's presence; malformed multibase reports under the same
      code.
- [x] 2.7 `check_wallet_record`: a NOTE (never a warning — `report()` reds a
      `--strict` run on warnings and LedgerxFactory runs `--strict`) naming how
      many keys a MULTI-KEY wallet declared and which, so a consumer gate can
      assert POSITIVELY that the keys it expects were adjudicated. Emitted only
      when the set has more than one member, so the packaged corpus stays quiet.
- [x] 2.8 Rule (r): `custody-model-mismatch` compares `custody_model_in_force`
      against the basis function in design D3 — the `keys[]` entry's custody when
      the presenting key is a `keys[]` member, the wallet's top-level custody
      when it is the primary key OR when no presenting key is ESTABLISHED.
      ESTABLISHED means `verified is True` (alignment concern 8); an unverified
      exercise takes the wallet's declaration exactly as today. Code unchanged;
      message names the basis.
- [x] 2.9 Rule (r): NEW `presenting-key-evidence-cap` — the grant's authority
      tier exceeds the ceiling of the presenting key's custody (design D3).
      GUARDED on `outcome == "permitted"` and on `verified is True`, like every
      other use-time cap; the exercise contract already closes a
      `custody_ceiling_exceeded` refusal code, and a record truthfully
      documenting that refusal must not itself be a finding (alignment defect 5).
- [x] 2.10 Rule (r): an exercise PERMITTED under a declared key whose `state` is
      `suspended` or `revoked` is refused under the EXISTING
      `revoked-chain-exercised` code (design D9). No new code: revocation
      checked at use is one rule.
- [x] 2.11 Correct `presenting-key-unresolved`'s message, which says the key "is
      no known wallet's `key_reference`" and after 2.2 is false (alignment
      concern 9a). The code and its pinned detail substring are NOT touched.
- [x] 2.12 Update the module docstring's rules (r) and (s) to say what they now
      check. No rule letter is reassigned.
- [x] 2.13 No finding code renamed, repurposed or reclassified; no new WARNING.
      Assert by diffing the code inventory before and after: exactly four new
      ERROR codes and zero new warnings.

## 3. The corpus — positives, one negative per new invariant, named probes

- [x] 3.1 POSITIVE: a multi-key wallet with MIXED custody — a stronger wallet
      declaring a WEAKER additional key — proving a key may be weaker than its
      wallet. Carries `public_key_multibase` on at least one entry so 2.6 is
      exercised on the happy path.
- [x] 3.2 POSITIVE: an exercise presented by a NON-PRIMARY declared key, with
      `custody_model_in_force` equal to THAT key's custody and a grant tier
      within that key's ceiling.
- [x] 3.3 NEGATIVE: presenting key not in the declared set →
      `presenting-key-unresolved`. The fixture names a key that LOOKS like a
      member of the multi-key wallet's set and is not, so it tests the SET
      boundary rather than a random unknown key.
- [x] 3.4 NEGATIVE: duplicate declared key ids → `declared-key-duplicate`.
- [x] 3.5 NEGATIVE: a `keys[]` entry with no `custody` → `schema`, with a detail
      pin so it keeps testing the invariant it is named for.
- [x] 3.6 NEGATIVE: a declared key whose ceiling outranks its wallet's →
      `declared-key-raises-authority`.
- [x] 3.7 NEGATIVE: an exercise whose grant tier exceeds the presenting key's
      ceiling, recorded as PERMITTED → `presenting-key-evidence-cap`.
- [x] 3.8 NEGATIVE: `custody_model_in_force` naming ANOTHER of the same wallet's
      keys' custody → `custody-model-mismatch`.
- [x] 3.9 NEGATIVE: a `key_fingerprint` that does not recompute from the entry's
      own `public_key_multibase` → `declared-key-fingerprint-mismatch`.
- [x] 3.10 NEGATIVE: an exercise permitted under a declared key whose `state` is
      `revoked` → `revoked-chain-exercised`.
- [x] 3.11 NEGATIVE: a SINGLE-KEY wallet whose exercise records a custody model
      the wallet does not declare → `custody-model-mismatch`. This is the
      no-op regression proof for the basis change (alignment defect 1): that
      code is currently unprobed by the shipped corpus, so nothing would have
      caught its silent deletion.
- [x] 3.12 Every new `wallet_id`, `grant_id` and declared `key_id` is DISJOINT
      from the packaged corpus, and the disjointness is ASSERTED in the pytest
      suite rather than assumed (alignment defect 4). A reused `key_id` makes
      `wallets_by_key` two-owner and flips every shipped exercise positive to
      ambiguous.
- [x] 3.13 NAMED-PROBE assertions for the new fixtures, following
      `add-per-seat-register-entries`' precedent: the new invariants attribute to
      EXISTING requirement ids, so the two-directional requirement closure
      cannot notice a deleted fixture (alignment concern 9b).
- [x] 3.14 Every new negative carries `# expected_failure:`, an
      `# expected_failure_detail:` pin where the generic `schema` finding would
      otherwise swallow it, and a `# requirement:` attribution. Requirement
      closure stays two-directional and green.
- [x] 3.15 pytest coverage for each new code, for the basis change, for the
      `verified is True` gate and for the retirement refusal, under
      `tests/multi_key_wallets/`.

## 4. Release bookkeeping — `wallet-v1.3`

- [x] 4.1 `contracts/manifest.yaml`: `contract_bundle_version: wallet-v1.3`; the
      `openxwallet-record` row's `sha256:` refreshed to the value this tree
      computes and that row's `schema_version: 1 → 2` (it mirrors the file's
      `contract_schema_version`); the other seven rows PROVEN unchanged by
      recomputation, not assertion.
- [x] 4.2 `contracts/CHANGELOG.md`: a `wallet-v1.3` entry stating the change
      class (ADDITIVE MINOR), that ONE digested artifact moved and which, the
      four new finding codes, the one changed comparison basis with the
      in-tree precedent for reusing `custody-model-unknown` at a new depth, the
      version-field reading from D8, and what a consumer must do (pin bump;
      nothing they declare becomes invalid).
- [x] 4.3 `contracts/openxwallet/README.md`: the record row and the opening
      "A wallet is a signing key…" sentence carry the key SET. No digest impact
      (the README is `pinned_by_commit_only`).
- [x] 4.4 Full local gate bar green: `verify-contract-pin.py`, the syntax gate,
      the validator plain AND `--strict`, `pytest tests/ -q`,
      `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0 openspec validate --all --strict`.
- [x] 4.5 `AGENTS.md`'s Speckit block moves to feature `015-multi-key-wallets`
      and stops naming feature 014's change as held (alignment concern 10).
- [x] 4.6 Annotated tag `wallet-v1.3` at the MERGE sha, after re-proving the gate
      bar at that head. Push the tag. `wallet-v1.3.digests.yaml` over
      `member_class: owned` members remains the OPERATOR act it has been since
      `wallet-v1.0` and is not produced here.
      **Correction (2026-08-28):** "has been since `wallet-v1.0`" was not
      true — the v1.0/v1.1 inventories were first cut 2026-08-28 (retroactive
      backfill; digests recomputed at each tag); the earlier sentence
      described an act that had not happened.

## 5. Consumer completion — openxFactory (tracked here, executed there)

- [x] 5.1 `governance/review-authority/wallets/wal-agent-mrc-0001.yaml` declares
      the four seat keys under `keys:`, fingerprints VERBATIM from the mint
      record, custody `holder_readable` each per design D7, `did` and
      `public_key_multibase` DERIVED from the mint record's public halves by the
      `did:key` encoding the live root key already uses. The root key's
      declaration is byte-untouched.
- [x] 5.2 `contracts/openxwallet-pin.yaml` + the gitlink move to the
      `wallet-v1.3` sha; the `openxwallet-record` digest row refreshed; the other
      seven rows unchanged.
- [x] 5.3 The consumer gate proves THREE things: the register's 4-of-4 seat-key
      note still fires; the wallet record validates with FIVE declared keys
      (asserted against 2.7's note, positively, not by absence of failure); and
      the register's and the wallet's fingerprints for each of the four seat keys
      AGREE — proven by computation in the pull request, since the cross-surface
      check itself is a named successor (alignment concern 11).

## 6. Ledger ticks this discharges

- [x] 6.1 `openspec/changes/add-per-seat-register-entries/tasks.md` §7.3 — the
      several-keys successor, whose trigger this change answers.
- [x] 6.2 `openspec/changes/add-per-seat-register-entries/design.md` "Named
      successors" item 3.
- [x] 6.3 `specs/014-per-seat-register-entries/spec.md` "Out of scope" — the
      several-keys line, annotated with where it went.
- [x] 6.4 `openspec/specs/openxwallet/spec.md` `## Purpose`: "a signing key
      anchored to a decentralized identifier" becomes the key SET. NO DELTA FORM
      REACHES `## Purpose` (alignment item 12), so this is an editorial
      correction made in the realization and ratified by this change; without it
      the promoted spec ships contradicting its own first requirement.

## 7. Named successors — NOT taken here (design D6)

- [ ] 7.1 Subwallets.
- [ ] 7.2 Per-key grants.
- [ ] 7.3 Delegation chains (a key authorizing another key).
- [ ] 7.4 Shared holders (one key declared by two wallets).
- [ ] 7.5 A cross-surface fingerprint-agreement check between the register's
      `seat_keys[]` and the same key's wallet declaration — capability
      `review-authority-register-reader`, not `openxwallet`. Narrowed by 2.6:
      each surface now proves its own fingerprint, and what remains unchecked is
      only that the two describe the same 32 bytes.
- [ ] 7.6 Per-key custody in hermes-install's projection. TRIGGER: the first
      wallet whose declared keys carry DIFFERENT custody models and are both
      projected. Until then `custody_model_in_force` matches without a change.
- [ ] 7.7 An independent OPTIONAL `custody` block on `key_reference`, so the
      wallet's issuance ceiling and its primary key's per-key custody can
      diverge (design D10). Additive when wanted; nothing needs it yet.

## Realization evidence (release-realization: this change archives on this)

- **Packet** PR #7, merged `f8ed764`; ratification recorded at `225be34`
  (`Status: ratified`, Brett Heap, operator authority, 2026-08-28).
- **Realization** PR #8, merged `6b248d4`; local bar green (validator 0/0 plain
  and `--strict`, `pytest tests/ -q` 90 passed, `openspec validate --all
  --strict` 5 passed), CI `pytest-suite` 89 passed 1 skipped — the skip is
  `test_this_version_adjudicates_the_previous_corpus_identically`, which skips
  LOUDLY with its reason when no baseline blob is reachable from a CI checkout,
  as designed.
- **Tag** `wallet-v1.3`, annotated, at `6b248d4` — the bar was re-proven at that
  exact head before tagging (validator 0/0, pytest 90 passed, openspec 5
  passed, and the one moved digest recomputed:
  `20ba39c07564c93b8ffe47382126677a165771244d28fb0c4976ab950173c40a`).
- **Consumer completion** openxFactory PR #480: `wal-agent-mrc-0001` declares
  the four seat keys, pin + gitlink → `wallet-v1.3`. Gate evidence from CI's
  own `wallet-validation` run — both positive notes, in one log:

      note  wallet 'wal-agent-mrc-0001': 5 declared key(s) adjudicated
            (key-mrc-0001, key-seat-company-policy-lead-0001,
             key-seat-lead-integration-0001, key-seat-lead-quality-0001,
             key-seat-lead-security-0001)
      note  intake register: 4 of 4 per-seat signing key(s) adjudicated and resolved

- **Fingerprint agreement**, proven by computation rather than asserted: for
  each of the four seats, the register's unpadded-base64url public half and the
  wallet's base58btc `public_key_multibase` decode to the SAME 32 bytes, and
  the fingerprint recorded on both surfaces recomputes from both. Four for four.
- **hermes-install: NO CHANGE REQUIRED**, determined and not assumed. Its
  exercise writer already emits the register-recorded `key_id` as
  `presenting_key_ref` (deliberately, over the ephemeral one) and the projected
  `custody_model` — `holder_readable` for every seat — as
  `custody_model_in_force`. Both now resolve against the wallet's declared set
  without an edit. The conditional successor is §7.6.

### At archive (2026-10-08, lane `openXwallet-2`)

Archived by `split-openwallet-neutral-core` task 2.1 with the pinned
`@fission-ai/openspec@1.12.0`, resolved through
`scripts/install-pinned-openspec-cli.py` and run as `openspec archive
add-multi-key-wallets --yes`: `openxwallet: update`, `~ 4 modified`,
`Totals: + 0, ~ 4, - 0, → 0`. Bytes checked rather than assumed: the four
files of this change were SHA-256-recomputed after the move and equal the
active change's, so the move edited nothing, and this section is the one edit
made after it. The four promoted requirement blocks equal this change's
MODIFIED blocks verbatim; the other four promoted requirements are untouched;
`## Purpose` keeps the key-SET wording §6.4 already put there, since the CLI
writes a TBD only for a spec it creates.

openxFactory's governed wrapper (`scripts/proposal-support.py` at
`44d8fbaf7d977668973dcd116040c9405416c2ea`) was NOT run — no checkout at that
commit was available — so its substance was checked by hand. The realization
evidence above is merged and tagged (`wallet-v1.3` at `6b248d4`) and the
consumer completion is merged (openxFactory PR #480). The CLI counted 46/53
boxes; the seven open boxes are §7.1–§7.7, the named successors `design.md` D6
declines, and they stay unticked on purpose. No row in §1–§6 is an archive-gate
row, so this section records the bar instead of ticking a box.

**The full gate bar, re-run at archive** (branch `archive/add-multi-key-wallets`
off `origin/main` `bf2dd4d`, with this archive applied):

- `python3 scripts/verify-contract-pin.py` — OK, 1 vendored file matches
  `contract_pin.yaml` at `openxFactory@30565e48ffe3` (bundle `contract-v1.44`).
- `python3 scripts/wallet-yaml-syntax-gate.py .` — exit 0.
- `python3 scripts/validate-openxwallet.py .` — 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `python3 scripts/validate-openxwallet.py . --strict` — 0 errors, 0
  warnings; corpus 21 positive examples, 45 negative confirmations across
  13/13 requirements (the same corpus note as before the archive).
- `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q` — 106 passed, 1 skipped (the designed loud

  reachable from this checkout).

  — **5 passed, 1 failed (6 items)**; before the archive it read 7 passed,
  0 failed (7 items). The failure is not this change's:

      change/add-composition-drift-cascade
        ✗ [ERROR] openxwallet/spec.md: MODIFIED "Revocation propagates through the chain" omits scenario(s) the current spec still has: "retiring one key does not revoke the wallet". Copy them into the MODIFIED block (a MODIFIED requirement replaces the whole block, so archive refuses to drop them).

  This is the collision `split-openwallet-neutral-core` measured in its
  `design.md` D0 and assigned in D9: rebasing that MODIFIED block onto the
  text this archive promoted is that packet's task 8.1, owed in openWallet's
  spec leg, and it is not made here. The `openspec` on PATH (1.6.0) reads
  6 passed, 0 failed over the same tree; the finding is 1.12's strictness.
